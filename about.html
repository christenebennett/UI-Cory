            <p>I’m a web dev intern and a full-stack web development student. When I’m not creating with code, I’m usually having a dance party with my kids or watching TV with my husband. To build the Gigapet API, I used Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and JSON
                Web Tokens.</p>

            <p>I first got started in learning how to code by taking advice from some programming friends and taking an introduction to web development course on UDEMY. Since dipping my toe into the water, I have now taken the plunge and am currently studying
                Full Stack Web Development at Lambda School online. I am also a proud father of two Sphynx cats. I love video games, fishing, archery, and currently exploring the fun talent of balcony gardening.</p>
